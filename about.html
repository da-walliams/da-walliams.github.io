<p>He specializes in typesetting mixed-mathematics Japanese texts with LaTeX, having worked on dozens of projects, including books on statistics, physics, mathematics, programming, and econometrics.</p>
<p>He has been recruited to join the translation team of a forthcoming econometrics textbook, leveraging his well-rounded background in English, familiarity with mathematical expressions, and interest in the formal sciences.</p>
<p>He aspires to a versatile career as a professional in publishing.</p>
<h3>As a Boogie-Woogie Lover</h3>
<p>Wally the Boogie’s private life is that of a music lover with a keen fondness for boogie-woogie music as well as Japanese pop music.</p>

<p>He admires many boogie-woogie players, including Les Frères, Keito Saito, and Axel Zwingenberger.</p>
<p>His primary preference lies in European boogie-woogie pianos after the boogie-woogie renaissance onward.</p>
<p>As an amateur boogie-woogie pianist, he has posted some of his performances on social media and has performed live on the street piano many times.</p>
